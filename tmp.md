## ideas for analysis

- analyze founders to see which ones are most successful
  - analyze ones in different areas, see how successful they each are, probably base success off of amount raised? should compare this to average in their respected areas in order to see which founders stand out compared to the general ones check out which ones founded multiple startups here, etc.
- analyze investors

  - see which ones give the most money
  - see which ones invest the most, moneywise, and by number of companies they invested in
  - take some sort of approximation of how good investors are based on how good the companies they invest in are, possibly compare it to actual investor data if that can be found

- analyze companies based on their data
  - compare different metrics for success: status (operating, exited, dead, etc) amount raised more detailed information than what's given about amount raised? - can analyze it by investor based on seed-db data and then get better data about investors, can do the same with crunchbase
  - compare different headquarters locations, chart on a map and see average amount raised
  - compare year founded to amount raised, possible that older companies get more money or something like that
  - analyze average y-combinator year+session to see distribution of how much money was given on average
  - analyze different categories, see how profitable each category is also see how risky a category is based on how many companies in that category died
  - do something based on the description of a company? possibly feed all of them into llama2 and ask it how it would rate it as a startup in 2023 and see if that's correlated to success somehow?
